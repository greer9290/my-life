This was an unexpected turn, hence the branch.

The initial plan was to spend 2 weeks in KC building our desktop laser cleaning platform (AL1), however we had a waffle cone factory go down in Pennsylvania.

So this guy has to go fix the precious lasers that clean the waffle cone baking trays, lest you be without your favorite ice cream cone type soon.

Now we will be in KC for 3 weeks.
