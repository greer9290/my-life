Great Lord's Day.

At Christ Church Leavenworth, heard a great sermon on the Feast of Booths, Neh. 8, and the relation to Christ and the giving of His Spirit being the fulfillment of that feast in many ways:

-The booths
-The water
-The light

Good stuff, fairly relaxing day.

Spent a couple hours anxious about what our next steps are as a family. Still not super clear.

Do we stay in FW and make this current situation work the best we can? Love the friends and church we have in FW, as well as proximity to family to help out as needed.

Or do we try to transition up to KC? Good job up here, getting better. Good church, just not as close to them yet since we have only visited 4 times or so. Further from family, however we are no strangers to long road trips last minute.. so this may not be as big of a deal if needed.


Praying for clarity and wisdom.
