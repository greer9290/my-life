    Welcome! I'm Ben Greer, a 30-something reluctant millennial who has spent my 20's adventuring around with my family, working on amazing high-tech laser equipment, road-tripping around the United States and flying around the globe from Israel, to Japan, to Germany. I enjoy meeting new people, feel free to reach out to me any time on any of the platforms linked.
    <br><br>
    I say reluctant millennial because I'm a trad-dad, ardent Christian, abortion abolitionist, tech entrepreneur, world traveler. I've been married 10 years and have had 7 kids (1 more on the way), with my wonderful wife Moriah. We do not live a common life, but we are definitely great sinners who have a great savior: Jesus Christ.
