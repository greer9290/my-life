        So, been a while since I've made an entry. My workload has expanded substantially, from finishing development of
        the AL1, to working on hiring a new engineer, to improving the service department workflow, to learning web dev
        and programming more and more. I'm practically out of time these days.
        <br><br>
        I've been spending a lot of free time on learning html and CSS, getting into Javascript now. The time I would be
        using making entries has been spent there.
        <br><br>
        Really too much to relate in one post, we have for the most part decided to move back to KC at this point,
        barring any obvious providences to stay in Fort Worth, this is the direction we will be pursuing.
        <br><br>
        I'm praying constantly about the decision, it's really a matter of practicality at this point. I have a solid
        job up here and know there is a solid church, the housing market is a lot cooler and affordable here as well.
        Barring some miraculous answer from my grandad about the house in Fort Worth, and a solid job landed there,
        moving back here is the most sensible move for the mid- and long-term from my vantage point.
        <br><br>
        At our current earnings pace, based on the state of the market and demand in Texas vs KS or Missouri, it is much
        more feasible to reach our goals up here within 5 years as far as getting some acreage to raise the boys on.
        <br><br>
        I can learn the skills I want to learn here more readily than the one job I know I could get in FW at Lockheed.
        That's still a possibility but when I weigh the options between punching a ticket at Lockheed or grinding here
        and continuously building more skills and building equity and clout in the company, eventually being able to
        branch out on my own... the choice seems weighted towards KC.
        <br><br>
        Church-wise it's a more even split, I love the people at All Saints as well as here at Christ Church. We could
        fit equally well as a family into both congregations, and do.
        <br><br>
        At the end of the day, I don't think it's a zero sum game... but I do have to focus energy into establishing our
        family into one place.
        <br><br>
        Weighing those options, this one seems like the best one. But I am still prayerful and seeking counsel as I'm
        able.
        <br><br>
        Gonna go swap the website to grid layout now.

        Ben</p>
