<h1>08/18/2023 Friday</h1>
<p>Yesterday was a rough day, woke up sick and achey (sp?). Powered through and showed up at the KC HQ of Adapt Laser.

We have been listening to the Westminster Shorter Catechism by Brian Sauve as a family in the mornings. Q1-10 currently. The plan is to walk through those questions once a day for a month.

I've been wiring up the electrical panel and fine-tuning the Arduino program for the second desktop laser cleaning station we are building at Adapt.
Also started to help out with a Fanuc + cleanLASER + Luna Terahertz sensor integration project.

Of course, answered many customer requests and got a shipment of maintenance materials out the door for a project in Pennsylvania next week.

Not looking forward to it, but I'll probably be on the road Monday-Friday next week knocking out 2 customer issues.

Goals today:
-Continue Git course on Udemy
-Finish on-panel wiring for AL1
-Begin resolution process for Luna project

Today I am starting the hopeful life pattern of cataloging the past days events, current days plans and miscellania of life.</p>
