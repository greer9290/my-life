<p class="formatted-p">Yesterday was a rough day, woke up sick and achey (sp?). Powered through and showed up at the KC HQ of Adapt Laser.
<br /><br />
We have been listening to the Westminster Shorter Catechism by Brian Sauve as a family in the mornings. Q1-10 currently. The plan is to walk through those questions once a day for a month.
<br /><br />
I've been wiring up the electrical panel and fine-tuning the Arduino program for the second desktop laser cleaning station we are building at Adapt.
Also started to help out with a Fanuc + cleanLASER + Luna Terahertz sensor integration project.
<br /><br />
Of course, answered many customer requests and got a shipment of maintenance materials out the door for a project in Pennsylvania next week.
<br /><br />
Not looking forward to it, but I'll probably be on the road Monday-Friday next week knocking out 2 customer issues.
<br /><br />
Goals today: <br />
-Continue Git course on Udemy <br />
-Finish on-panel wiring for AL1 <br />
-Begin resolution process for Luna project <br />
<br /><br />
Today I am starting the hopeful life pattern of cataloging the past days events, current days plans and miscellania of life.</p>
