The initial plan was to spend 2 weeks in KC building our desktop laser cleaning platform (AL1), however we had a waffle cone factory go down in Pennsylvania.
<br><br>
So this guy has to go fix the precious lasers that clean the waffle cone baking trays, lest you be without your favorite ice cream cone type soon.
<br><br>
Now we will be in KC for 3 weeks.

Signing out,
