<h1>09/09/2023</h1>
<p> Sitting here on Saturday morning, just went to help Pastor Spratt load up a giant 16 foot oak railing they will put in the SDA church Christ Church Leavenworth is renting.
    <br><br>
    It's been a good week, very busy yet many opportunities for hard work, creativity, ingenuity and problem-solving. Steve and I potentially solved two in-house customer issues this week that had been pending a while.
    <br><br>
    I'll be heading out to Seattle on Tuesday to go deal with a customer issue. Should be a quick trip, one night stay. I found a boat to stay in! Gonna be cool. Hopefully I'll have pictures of that soon.
    <br><br>
    Not much deep reflection this week or study, just grinding through issues. Bought a Toyota Yaris and put new tires on that, then our van had a flat so I had to get that fixed at the same time.
    <br><br>
    All is well, Manny will be here for lunch around 12:30p. Looking forward to that, then maybe the gun range.
    <br><br>
    We plan to watch "Sage Against the Machine", a documentary on Canon+ about George Gilder's legacy. Listened to a bit of it during driving today, and it seems well worth the time.
    <br><br>
    Signing out,
    <br />
